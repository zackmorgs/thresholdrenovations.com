						<p>What you see here was once an outdoor playhouse. With thoughtful reuse of materials and careful craftsmanship, we transformed it into a weather-tight farmstand. Sometimes people choose a more recycled approach to minimize their environmental impact: taking what exists and re-imagining it into something functional, durable, and beautiful. We partner with clients to bring their sustainable ideas to life in practical ways, proving that green building can be both creative and achievable.</p>
